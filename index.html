        <b> People </b> visit a wise man complaining about the same problems
        over and over again. One day, he decided to tell them a joke and they
        all roared with laughter. After a few minutes, he told them the same
        joke and only a few of them smiled. Then he told the same joke for a
        third time, but no one laughed or smiled anymore. The wise man smiled
        and said: You canâ€™t laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you
        always crying about the same problem.
